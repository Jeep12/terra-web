                            <strong>Terra is beginning</strong> and we want to welcome you to a project born
                            from our passion for Lineage II and the community that surrounds it. We know that many
                            private
                            servers of
                            this game have a short lifespan, closing within a few months and leaving players with a
                            feeling of
                            loss
                            and disappointment. That's why, at Terra, our commitment is different.

                            We want to create a stable and lasting server, where players feel that their progress is
                            valued and
                            where
                            decisions are made with the long-term experience in mind. Our commitment is that the server
                            will be
                            available for at least 2 years after the beta phase ends. If the community desires it and
                            the server
                            is
                            sustainable, we are open to extending its duration.
