        <p>Welcome to our private Lineage 2 server powered by L2JMobius. This Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your
          access to and use of our server, website, forums, Discord, and related services (collectively, the “Service”).
          By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
          these Terms.</p>

        <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
        <p>By using the Service, you affirm that you are at least thirteen (13) years of age or that you have obtained
          parental or guardian consent to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority, you confirm that your
          parent or guardian accepts these Terms on your behalf.</p>

        <h3>2. Nature of the Service</h3>
        <p>The Service is an unofficial, fan-operated private server based on the Lineage 2 game engine. We are not
          affiliated with or endorsed by NCSOFT or any of its affiliates. Any references to NCSOFT in the Service are
          for descriptive purposes only.</p>

        <h3>3. Account Creation & Responsibility</h3>
        <p>To access the Service, you must create an account and provide a valid email address. Keep your login
          credentials confidential. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We are
          not liable for losses resulting from unauthorized access caused by your failure to safeguard your account.</p>

        <h3>4. Server Rules & Community Conduct</h3>
        <p>As a user of the Service, you agree to comply with the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No unauthorized software, botting, macros, or scripted automation.</li>
          <li>No exploitation of bugs, glitches, or unintended game mechanics.</li>
          <li>No harassment, hate speech, threats, or abusive language directed at other users or staff.</li>
          <li>No advertising or solicitation of external services without prior approval.</li>
          <li>No disruptive behavior, including spamming, trolling, or griefing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Violation of these rules may result in penalties ranging from warnings and temporary suspensions to permanent
          bans, at our sole discretion.</p>

        <h3>5. Donations & In-Game Purchases</h3>
        <p>We may offer optional donation packages or in-game benefits. All purchases are voluntary and non-refundable.
          These donations do not constitute a sale of goods; they are contributions to support the maintenance and
          operation of the Service. We reserve the right to change, modify, or revoke donor benefits at any time without
          prior notice.</p>

        <h3>6. Service Availability & Changes</h3>
        <p>We strive to maintain continuous availability of the Service, but we do not guarantee uptime or uninterrupted
          access. We may perform maintenance, updates, or modifications at any time, which may require temporary
          downtime. We are not responsible for any loss of data or inaccessibility during such periods.</p>

        <h3>7. Termination of Access</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service or related accounts for any reason,
          including but not limited to violation of these Terms, legal obligations, or technical disruptions. Upon
          termination, your right to access the Service immediately ceases, and you waive any claims against us arising
          from the termination.</p>

        <h3>8. Limited Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>The Service is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether
          express or implied. We disclaim all warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
          and non-infringement. We make no guarantees regarding performance, availability, or fitness of the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we, our affiliates, employees, or licensors be
          liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the
          Service. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Service shall not exceed the
          amount of donations made by you in the six (6) months preceding the incident.</p>

        <h3>10. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All intellectual property rights in game assets, software, graphics, trademarks, and other materials are
          owned by their respective copyright holders. This Service does not transfer any intellectual property rights
          to you.</p>

        <h3>11. Modifications to Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time. Changes become effective when posted on our website or
          announced to users. Continued use of the Service after changes indicates your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h3>12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of law principles.
          Any dispute shall be resolved exclusively by the courts located in [Your Jurisdiction].</p>
